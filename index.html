  <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
  <p>I'm Sri Krishna Bharadwaj Eyunni, currently pursuing my Master of Science in Data Science, Analytics, and Engineering at Arizona State University. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Data Science (AI and ML) from Lovely Professional University. My academic background has been complemented by hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Cloud Computing.</p>
  <p>I am driven by a passion for solving real-world problems through data. My focus lies in leveraging modern AI tools and cloud infrastructure to build intelligent systems that scale. From designing data pipelines and deploying ML models to creating dashboards and interfaces for insight delivery, I enjoy every part of the data lifecycle.</p>
